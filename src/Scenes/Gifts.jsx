We’ll be husband and wife for the rest of our life,
In our little home made for two.
But instead of a vase or a new kitchen knife,
We’d love to fly off to somewhere new.
A week on a beach would suffice and be ideal,
So instead of a gift, your contribution would help to buy us a hotel room or a romantic meal!
